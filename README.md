# Blockchain art gallery

This project is a basic interaction with the blockchain, where you can draw a sketch, give it a title and it will be uploaded to the project gallery.

It has a smart contract developed with solidity, and a fronted client developed with Next.js.

I made this project following [this guideline](https://app.buildspace.so/projects/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b) made by buildspace, and I encourage you to follow it too.
